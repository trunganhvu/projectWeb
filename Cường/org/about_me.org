I live in Los Angeles with my wife, Alyssa, and our dog, Dempsey.  When not
doing science, I love exploring the area with Alyssa and Dempsey: hiking the
many nearby mountain trails (Dempsey's favorite), trying new restaurants and
coffee shops, running, going to the dog park, seeing movies, and just relaxing
at home together.  I'm also an avid music fan/critic and book reader.
