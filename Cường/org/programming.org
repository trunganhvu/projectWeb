* Python
I am an avid user of the [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] programming language, which is modern, powerful,
elegant, open-source, and well-documented.  I use the [[http://ipython.org/][IPython]] environment and
rely on the [[http://xarray.pydata.org][xarray]], [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]], [[http://scipy.org/][SciPy]], and [[http://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] modules to analyze climate
model data via the free [[https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/][Anaconda]] distribution.

In addition to the [[file:aospy.org][aospy]] project, I also have a few other, less polished
open-source Python packages that I have created as side projects; they are
available on [[https://github.com/spencerahill][my Github]].

** Pangeo-data
There is a growing discrepancy between the scale of data that is generated by
climate models and observational products and the capability of tools commonly
used by scientists to analyze that data.  Fortunately, the [[http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/][dask]] Python package
enables parallel computations on a single node and works with ~xarray~ largely
with little effort by the user.  For multi-node computing environments,
[[https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][dask.distributed]] provides the same functionality across nodes, and it is
actively being developed to work with data represented via ~xarray~ to provide
similarly user-friendly computations on climate data that is parallelized across
multiple nodes.

[[https://www.github.com/pangeo-data][pangeo-data]] is an organization of climate scientists and computer scientists
that seeks to build tools useful to climate data analysis and that harness the
power of xarray + dask + dask.distributed.  We are actively seeking new users
and contributions; please see the Github page linked above for more information.

** Python packages I haven't tried but look cool
Take a look at my [[https://github.com/spencerahill?tab=stars][Github "stars"]] for a list of the many packages that I've found
interesting or useful.

* Emacs & Org-Mode
** Overview
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] is a powerful text editor that I use for as many tasks as I can.  [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]]
is an extension of Emacs for creating outline-like documents, with many powerful
tools for embedding to-do lists, links, code, and images and for converting the
files to LaTeX, HTML, and other formats.

This integration of elements typically found in scientific manuscripts makes
Org-mode a potentially useful vehicle for [[http://reproducibleresearch.net/][reproducible research]] -- checkout this
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA&list=FLQp2VLAOlvq142YN3JO3y8w][YouTube video]] by John Kitchin, a chemical engineering professor at Carnegie
Mellon.  He also has a nice [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/08/08/What-we-are-using-org-mode-for/][page]] highlighting the powers of Org-mode in
reproducible research and beyond.

In fact, my website and CV are written entirely as org-mode files, which I then
publish to HTML (and PDF for the CV) using Org-Mode's Publish functionality.
The source code for all this is available as a [[https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website][Github repository]].
